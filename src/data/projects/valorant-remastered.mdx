## Overview

The Witcher 3 Showcase is a cinematic single-page site that celebrates CDPR's worldbuilding. It layers moody gradients, enchanted particle systems, and choreographed scroll-driven scenes to recreate the feel of roaming the Continent.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- React
- GSAP
- Three.js

## TL;DR

I recreated my favorite Awwwards layouts but swapped the narrative for Geralt of Rivia. The goal was to practice complex parallax, shader-driven fog, and micro-interactions that echo Witcher signs.
